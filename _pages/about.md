Recent Ph.D. graduate in theoretical condensed matter physics at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). Currently looking for work in bioinformatics and data science sectors. :woman_technologist:

My Ph.D. research was carried out in the [Condensed Matter Theory group](https://neel.cnrs.fr/equipes-poles-et-services/theorie-de-la-matiere-condensee-tmc) at the [Néel Institute](https://neel.cnrs.fr/) in Grenoble, France. My dissertation work centered on understanding novel forms of electronic correlation arising from long-range interactions in quantum lattice models. 

My studies originally began at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) where I majored in physics and mathematics. Before settling in Grenoble, I completed an Erasmus Mundus joint master's degree in physics that was hosted jointly by the [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), and [La Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). 

In my free time, I enjoy trying out new vegetarian recipes and hiking, climbing, or skiing in the mountains surrounding Grenoble. :mountain_snow:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
