Recent Ph.D. graduate in theoretical condensed matter physics at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). Currently looking for work in bioinformatics and data science sectors.

My Ph.D. research was carried out in the [Condensed Matter Theory group](https://neel.cnrs.fr/equipes-poles-et-services/theorie-de-la-matiere-condensee-tmc) at the [Néel Institute](https://neel.cnrs.fr/) in Grenoble, France. My dissertation work centered on understanding novel forms of electronic correlation arising from long-range interactions in quantum lattice models. 

Before settling in Grenoble, I completed an Erasmus Mundus joint master's degree in physics that was hosted jointly by the [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), and [La Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). 

In my free time, I enjoy trying out new vegetarian recipes and hiking, climbing, or skiing in the mountains surrounding Grenoble (see below). 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
