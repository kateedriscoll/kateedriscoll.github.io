Computational physicist by training; computational biologist in practice :dna:.

I obtained my Ph.D. in theoretical condensed matter physics at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and have been working as a Computational Biologist at [DeepLife](https://deeplife.co) since 2022 :woman_technologist:

My Ph.D. research was carried out in the [Condensed Matter Theory group](https://neel.cnrs.fr/equipes-poles-et-services/theorie-de-la-matiere-condensee-tmc) at the [Néel Institute](https://neel.cnrs.fr/) in Grenoble, France. My dissertation work centered on understanding novel forms of electronic correlation arising from long-range interactions in quantum lattice models. 

My studies originally began at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) where I majored in physics and mathematics. Before settling in Grenoble, I completed an Erasmus Mundus joint master's degree in physics that was hosted jointly by the [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), and [La Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). 

In my free time, I enjoy trying out new vegetarian recipes and hiking, climbing, or skiing in the mountains surrounding Grenoble. :mountain_snow:
