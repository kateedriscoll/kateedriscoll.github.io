I've been working as a Computational Biologist at [DeepLife](https://www.deeplife.co/) for 1 year and 9 months now. In that time I have learned a lot of new skills and lessons from some truly amazing people as I have transitioned from academia to industry, and from condensed matter physics to techbio. That being said, I would love to share some of this knowledge in a public setting in case it is of use to others who find themselves on a similar journey. 

I'm slowly getting around to updating my website and am considering adding a notes section here that summarizes some of my recent work. Some topics I'm considering are:

- DevOps best practices (learned the hard way :joy:)
- Intro to single-cell RNA sequencing data
- Reflections on single-cell foundation models
- Thoughts on project management & leadership
- Intro to the drug discovery pipeline for non-biologists

Nothing is written in stone and of course I still need to find the time to fit this in around my fulltime job, but hopefully I can keep this page updated with interesting tidbits on a more regular basis!
