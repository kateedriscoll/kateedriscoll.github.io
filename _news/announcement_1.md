I recently finished my Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the University of Grenoble Alpes and am presently looking for gainful employment. Globally I'm interested in using computational methods to advance our knowledge and enrich our lives. More specifically, I'm studying deep learning techniques and would like to explore the applications of these techniques in bioinformatics.

***
Over the next few weeks/months, I plan to add more content here focusing on explaining my dissertation work and discussing the new, exciting bioinformatics techniques that I'm currently studying!
