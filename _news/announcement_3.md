I successfully defended my thesis titled "Long-range Coulomb interactions and charge frustration in strongly correlated quantum matter" on January 21, 2022. If you're interested in reading the manuscript, you can find it listed in my [publications](https://kateedriscoll.github.io/publications/). However, if you're more interested in a shorter version, I have attempted to condense it in my [projects](https://kateedriscoll.github.io/projects/) page.

***
The [general introduction](https://kateedriscoll.github.io/projects/1_project/) page introduces the overall motivations for the thesis and is probably the best place to start for non-specialists. My thesis is essentially made up of two projects which I have explained in more technical details in the other sections.
